# Electrocardiogram reader
Artificial intelligence applied to read abnormalities present in electrocardiogram images, made up of a convolutional neural network and a YOLOv3 detection model. The CNN is able to classifying electrocardiogram images in order to determine if the wave presented in the image is at risk of having heart problems, assigning the classification for this as healthy or risk status. based on a normal heartbeat, obtaining a response to the state of a patient's heart quickly and without prior knowledge of the risk factors present in the wave. The methodology that was carried out for the development of this project is presented in the article, which consists of a classificatory convolutional neural network, created in the Python programming language and with the help of two of the most important libraries on artificial intelligence, Tensorflow and Keras, characteristics of electrocardiograms and their risk factors with which we can identify when an electrocardiogram is not in good condition are also presented.
